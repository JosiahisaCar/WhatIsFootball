this is for the challege to add the football challenge to github.

the solution was to add a Text() element with the modifiers of .fontWeight(.ultraLight) and .foregroundStyle(.green) to create the thin green text on the content view. to add the icons
below the text each one could be formed with an Image() element with systemName: "string of icon" to decide what icon with the icons being figure.american.football, figure.alstralian.football and figure.soccer
to get them to be next to each other i nested them all in a horizontal stack "HStack{}" and to get them all the same size and to take up the same space i used the modifiers .resizable() and .scaledToFit()
to change the color i used .foregroundStyle() with each respective color
and the challenge was complete!
